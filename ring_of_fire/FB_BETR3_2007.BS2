'This program operates the hardware of the Bio Feedback exhibit of the OSC
'Question of Truth show.

'The hardware of the system comprises a basic stampII upon which this code
'is executed, a Thought Technologies calmpute is employed to do the actual
'GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) measurements and a Max 7219 LED dislplay chip
'provides the feedback stimulus output to the participant. This output is
'64 discrete LEDs arranged in a 23" diameter circular pattern.

'In addition to the visual Bio feed back system there is also
'an audio component to this exhibit comprising a CD player and Technovision
'PC II controller. The audio playback is started by a coinco push button.
'The Stamp has the capacity built in to both the software and the hardware
'of the custom PC board to start the playback of the CD tracks germaine to
'this exhibit automaticlly whenever a participants 'connect' themselves to
'the gsr sensor. A reed relay electriclly parralleled with the coinco
'accomplishes this. This audio automatic start feature however was not
'exploited for the show at opening however.


'For the purposes of this exhibit, changes in GSR have been accepted as a
'sufficiently accurate indicator of the participants level of stress.
'Instantaneous GSR readings at any point are only of significance when
'considered in context of their value relative to a reference point and
'the trends that successive readings indicate. In this case the reference
'point is taken as an initial reading close to the time the participant
'first 'connects' with the calmpute. The trends are established and
'fedback to the participant by varying the rate at which a few lit LED's
'are sequenced around the 23 inch diameter ring.

'The calmpute is a device made by Thought Technologies of Belgrave Ave
'Montreal PQ (514-489-8251 voice 514-489-8255 fax) to measure GSR. The
'calmpute derrives it's operating power from an internal 9v battery
'and is designed to provide a true rs232 level signal to a line of a
'seral port on a PC. The output of the calmpute is opto isolated for
'participants safety.

'The circuit board custom produced for this exhibit bears the name:

'  "Calmpute Interface PCB 09/96"

'This PC Board is equipped with a male DB25 connector wired so as to be
'directly compatible with the calmpute. The rs232 signal between the
'stamp and the calmpute is 0 - 5v levels.

'The calmpute o/p appears to the stamp as a pulse of varying duration. The
'stamp's pulsein command is used to measure the length of the pulse.
'Values in the 10,000 - 25,000 range as reported by the pulsin command are
'typical for participants although counts up to 30,000 are reported in
'cases of a direct short at the calmpute electrodes. When the calmpute
'electrodes are open circuit (ie: no participant connected), a zero count
'is reported by the pulsin command.

'Since each participant potentially has a different initial gsr reading
'the  program stores the gsr value from the second execution cycle after
'a participant is detected. A zero count from the pulsin command is
'interpreted to mean no one is connected to the calmpute, as soon as the
'count becomes non zero a few cycles are taken up with establishing inital
'values for later reference.

'Constant declaration:

' Hardware interface with the 7219:
DATA_n  CON  7  ' Bits are shifted out this pin # to 7219.
CLK     CON  5  ' Data valid on rising edge of this clock pin.
Load    CON  6  ' Tells 7219 to transfer data to LEDs.

' Register addresses for the MAX7219. To control a given attribute
' of the display, for instance its brightness or the number shown
' in a particular digit, you write the register address followed
' by the data. For example, to set the brightness, you'd send
' 'brite' followed by a number from 0 (off) to 15 (100% bright).
decode   CON  9  ' Decode register; a 1 turns on BCD decoding.
brite  CON  10  ' "       "   " intensity register.
scan  CON  11  ' "       "   " scan-limit register.
switch  CON  12  ' "       "   " on/off register.
test  CON  15  ' Activates test mode (all digits on, 100% bright)
'__________________________________________________________________
'Variable declaration:
' Variables used in the program.
max_dat  VAR  Word  ' Word to be sent to MAX7219.
index   VAR  Nib  ' Index into setup table.
bp  VAR  Nib  ' bit position counter
temp  VAR  Nib  ' Temporary variable used in outputting digits.
flp  VAR  Bit  ' Flag used in changing directions.
dispVal  VAR  Byte (10)' Value to be displayed on the LEDs
nina  VAR  Byte  'led bit on counter
ninit  CON  7  'initial nina value
carry  VAR  Bit  'shift carry flag
cycle  VAR  Byte  'display 'digit' counter
odd  VAR  index.BIT0  ' Lsb of index.
top  VAR  Byte
gsr  VAR  Word  'gsr pulse length
gsra  VAR  Word  'average gsr pulse length
gsrinit  VAR  Word  'storeage of inital gsr value
av  VAR  Byte  'average base counter
'chance  var  word  'downtime rate randomizer
led  VAR  Byte  'led test shift variable
initr  VAR  Nib  'counter for gsr init sample

' The program begins by setting up all pins to output low, matching
' the state established by the pulldown resistors.
OUTS = 0    ' All output latches low.
DIRS = $FFFF    ' All pins to output.

' Next, it initializes the MAX7219. A lookup table is convenient way
' to organize the setup data; each register address is paired with
' its setting data. The table sets the scan limit to 4 (5 digits,
' numbered 0-4); brightness to 3; BCD decoding to the lower 5 digits
' (the only ones we're displaying), and switches the display on. The
' MAX7219 expects data in 16-bit packets, but our lookup table holds
' a series of 8-bit values. That's why the loop below is designed to
' pulse the Load line _every_other_ byte transmitted.
FOR index = 0 TO 7    ' Retrieve 8 items from table.
  LOOKUP index,[scan,7,brite,15,decode,$00,switch,1],max_dat
  SHIFTOUT DATA_n,CLK,MSBFIRST,[max_dat]
  IF odd = 0  THEN noLoad  ' If odd is 1, pulse Load line.
  PULSOUT Load,1
NoLoad:        ' Else, don't pulse.
NEXT        ' Get next item from table.

' ====================== MAIN PROGRAM LOOP ==========================
' Now that the MAX7219 is properly initialized, we're ready to send it
' data. The loop below increments a 16-bit counter and displays it on
' the LEDs connected to the MAX. Subroutines below handle the details
' of converting binary values to binary-coded decimal (BCD) digits and
' sending them to the MAX.

  'dispVal(5) = 1
  'dispVal.bit0(8)=1
  'debug ? dispVal(1)
  'carry = 1
Loop:
  'for cycle = 1 to 56
  'if cycle = nina then on
  'carry=0
  'goto off
on:  'carry=1
off:  'gosub MaxDisplay
  'dispVal.bit7(cycle) = carry
  'next
  'nina=nina+1 max 56
  'goto loop

' ========================= SUBROUTINES ============================
' The MAX7219 won't accept a number like "2742" and display it on
' the LEDs. Instead, it expects the program to send it individual
' digits preceded by their position on the display. For example,
' "2742" on a five-digit display would be expressed as:
' "digit 5: blank; digit 4: 2; digit 3: 7; digit 2: 4; digit 1: 2"
' The routine MaxDisplay below does just that, separating a value
' into individual digits and sending them to the MAX7219. If the
' lefthand digits are zero (as in a number like "102") the
' routine sends blanks, not zeros until it encounters the first
' non-zero digit. This is called "leading-zero blanking."
